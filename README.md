## Project Overview
This project uses the **Wine dataset** from scikit-learn to build a **multi-class classification model** using **Logistic Regression**.

## Dataset
The Wine dataset consists of 13 chemical properties of wine samples categorized into three different classes.

## Model Used
- **Logistic Regression** (One-vs-Rest approach)
- Standardized features using **StandardScaler** from scikit-learn.

## Results
- Model Accuracy: ~ (insert actual accuracy after running)
- Confusion matrix and classification report included.
